# Unit-5-Project-OOP-Game-Show

This web page allows a user to see 12 employees from a company. This website fethces the user's data from an API and displays all the users as cards on a screen. If a user is clicked on, a modal appears showing more information than the user could see from just the small user card on the main screen.

## Usage

Use this thing if you enjoy employees, scrolling through a list of employees, being employed, employing, fake employees with fake data, fetching data from APIs, and a mellow yet punctual color scheme. 

This Webpage uses fetch API to get data from the randomuser API
